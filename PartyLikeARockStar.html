			<h1><span class="AliceBlue">It's Hot in Jaco! The Wild Side of Costa Rica Nightlife.</span></h1>
			<p>Jaco Beach is the epi-center of Costa Rica's nightlife. The party scene is regularly expanding with new dance clubs, beach bars and trendy restaurants offering live music or DJ sets. Back in the day, Jaco was a sleepy surfer town with dirt roads and rice &amp; beans restaurants... but in the last 13 years Jaco Beach has grown into having the hottest nightlife scene, and the undisputed reputation as party capital of Costa Rica!</p>

			
			<h2><span class="BlizzardBlue">2022 Guide to the Best Nightlife in Jaco Beach.</span></h2>
			<p><span class="TangerineYellow"><strong>The nightlife in Jaco is off the charts.</strong></span> Tourists vacation in Jaco from all over the world, as well as many locals from the capital city of San Jose, who come to enjoy the beach and of course the clubs, bars and party scene. It is common to see groups of guys on a Costa Rica <a href="CostaRicaBachelorParty.html" target="new"><span class="BlizzardBlue2">bachelor party</span></a> or a group of ladies together for a <a href="BacheloretteParty.html" target="new"><span class="BlizzardBlue2">bachelorette party</span></a>, as well as sport fishing tournaments, business / corporate retreats, and all kinds of family vacations.</p> <!-- <p><span class="TangerineYellow bold">Stop reading out-dated online forums!</span> Don't waste half your vacation trying to figure out what to do and where to go. The Jaco VIP Concierge Team lives here in Jaco and will escort you to all the best spots in town.</p> -->
			
			<h3>Republik Lounge</h3>
			<p>The most popular club for VIP tables and bottle service is without a doubt <a href="republik-jaco.html" target="new"><span class="BlizzardBlue2">Republik Lounge</span></a> in the center of Jaco. It is located inside of the newly renovated <a href="hotel-blue-marlin-jaco-costa-rica.html" target="new"><span class="BlizzardBlue2">Blue Marlin Hotel</span></a> and boasts the best DJs, sound system and light show in town.</p>

		<div class="main" style="padding-top: 12px">
			<p>The entire club was recently built from the ground up and opened it's doors in March 2022. Everything is brand new and well laid out. The main interior area has 2 bars, plenty of vip tables and a dance floor in the center. Brand new state of the art sound system and modern LED light show has inspired DJs to come to Jaco Beach from all over the country just to play at this club.</p>
				
			<p>The exterior of Republik lounge includes a large pool bar with covered vip areas as well as plenty of tables and chairs around the swimming pool. Among the many <a href="things-to-do-jaco-costa-rica.html"><span class="BlizzardBlue2">things to do in Jaco</span></a> during the day, swing by Republik to take a dip in the pool, have a fancy cocktail and get a bite to eat. Saturday and Sunday afternoons are especially vibrant with resident and guest DJs spinning tunes pool side.</p>
			
			<h3>Cocal Casino</h3>
			<p>The most famous (or maybe notorious) nightlife in Costa Rica is at the <a href="Hotel-Cocal-Jaco-CostaRica.html" target="new"><span class="BlizzardBlue2">Cocal Hotel and Casino</span></a> which is a few steps away from Republik, on the beach, and smack in the center of Jaco. Aside from being a popular casino and hotel, the outdoor pool bar area (aka Frog's Bar) is party central. On some nights there is a live Latin music duo. The party usually gets started pretty early, and is not for the faint at heart.</p>

		<div class="main" style="padding-top: 12px">
			
			<p>Although Cocal is technically on the beach, and could fit in the "beach bar" section below, it is also an <strong>adults-only</strong> party scene which is not suitable for everyone.</p>
			
			<h4>More Night Clubs in Jaco Center</h4>
			<p>There are a few new bars that have popped up in the last couple of years (since covid shut down a few of the old ones), some of which will find a niche and stay open, and others will also be closed within a few months... Those which have been around for a while on the main strip in Jaco center include Orange Pub, The Black Marlin and Man Cave which are all within walking distance of each other.</p>
			
			<h2><span class="BlizzardBlue"><strong>Beach Bars</strong></span></h2>
			<p><span class="TangerineYellow bold">Happy Hour Sunset Views!</span> Hanging out on the beach with toes in the sand and a beer in hand is a very popular way to spend the golden hour in Jaco. There are some fantastic beach bars in Jaco with ocean and sunset views. Listed below are just a couple of our favorites.</p>
			
			<h3>Koko Gastro Bar</h3>
			<p>This popular beachfront restaurant, can be accessed by walking along the beach, or at the end of the only dirt road left in Jaco! Koko has amazing food and at reasonable prices. They make a great breakfast, and always have fresh tuna (try the tuna bowl). They offer a good selection of local beers and some great snacks.</p>

		<div class="side"></div>
		<div class="main" style="padding-top: 12px">
			
			<p>Koko occasionally has live music, but not a full band, usually a duo... and sometimes a DJ. Although it gets very busy and with an upbeat vibe, it's not that loud. This is a great place to enjoy good food, drinks, and conversation.</p>
			
			
			<h3>El Point</h3>
			<p>El Point is another popular beachfront bar in Jaco with very good food and exceptional sunset views. They have a diverse menu from healthy meals to bar snacks as well as a decent selection of beers and premium alcohol. Perhaps a little more pricey, but not really.. still reasonable.</p>

			<p>Very popular place for lunch and happy hour. Sometimes they have a DJ in the evening. Great tuna dishes (always fresh) and exceptional seafood platter with lobster.</p>
			
			<h4>More Restaurant Bars on the Beach...</h4>
			<p>Aloha, Mahi Mahi and Tiki Bar at the South end of town. Clarita's at the north end. Near the center is Malecon, Jaco Hotel and also The Tangeri, all of which you can grab a snack and a drink while watching the sunset.</p>
			
			<h2><span class="BlizzardBlue"><strong>Craft Beer &amp; Live Music</strong></span></h2>
			<h3>The Green Room</h3>
			<p>If you are looking to catch some live music... The <a href="https://greenroomjaco.com/" target="new" rel="nofollow"><span class="BlizzardBlue">Green Room</span></a> is an artsy urban oasis in the center of town. Located right next to Republik Lounge, this is a popular place to grab a bite to eat before heading out to party. Great open air vibe, with artisan food, mixology drinks, wide selection of craft beer (try the mango beer), decent wine list, and live music every night of the week.</p>

			<p>Green Room has a great selection of breakfast dishes (not for early birds - they open at 10am). Excellent choices for lunch (try the casadito) and a good place to bring the laptop to catch up on some emails or get a little work done at the same time.</p>
			
			<h3>Jaco Bar</h3>
			<p>Located on Main Street (Calle Pastor Diaz) in the center of town, this second floor hot-spot is small but packs them in. Either with a small live band or a DJ, there is often a good time here. The food and drinks are resonably priced.</p>

			<p>There are half day and full day charters available. The half day is perfect with 4 hours of cruising up and down the coast around Jaco Beach and Los Sueños Marina, with a couple of stops at some secluded beaches. The full day charter is ideal if you want to have a private boat take you to Tortuga Island so that you can enjoy the island activities as well as check out the quiet beaches where tourist boats don't go.</p>

			<h2><span class="BlizzardBlue"><strong>In Conclusion...</strong></span></h2>
			<p><span class="TangerineYellow"><strong>Jaco Beach has the best Nightlife in Costa Rica!</strong></span></p>
			<p>There are some good discos/casinos/clubs in San Jose, but they are far apart from each other, and in some cases sketchy neighborhoods.</p>
			<p>Tamarindo is a nice beach town with some good beach bars and restaurants. It is far from the airport and a small town with far less amenities.</p>
			<p>Jaco Beach is a vacation destination that caters to both international tourists and local weekenders looking for tropical paradise with plenty of daytime activities and a vibrant nightlfe scene. It is less than an hour and a half from the airport, and loaded with pretty much everything you could possibly want while on vacation in Costa Rica.</p>
